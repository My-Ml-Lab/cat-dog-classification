🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification
This repository contains a deep learning project that classifies images as either cats or dogs using a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras.


🧠 Model Highlights
Utilizes image augmentation techniques with ImageDataGenerator

CNN architecture built using Keras layers (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout)

Includes callbacks: EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint to improve performance

🧰 Libraries Used
The project is implemented in Python and uses the following libraries:

tensorflow – for deep learning model building and training

numpy – for numerical operations

matplotlib – for data visualization

os and shutil – for dataset directory handling

zipfile – for extracting datasets

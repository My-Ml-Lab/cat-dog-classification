🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification

A deep learning project that classifies images as either cats or dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras.


🧠 Model Highlights

✅ Image augmentation using ImageDataGenerator

✅ Custom CNN built with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, and Dropout

✅ Uses EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint for efficient training

✅ Visualizes accuracy/loss using Matplotlib

🧰 Libraries Used
This project uses:

🔢 numpy – numerical computations

📊 matplotlib – visualizations

🧠 tensorflow.keras – model, layers, and callbacks
